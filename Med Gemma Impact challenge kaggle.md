## What this competition is

This is a **hackathon-style Kaggle competition** (no provided dataset) where you build a **human-centered healthcare / life-sciences demo application** using **MedGemma** and/or other open models from **Google’s Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI‑DEF)**.

## Key dates (UTC)

From the competition Timeline page:
- **Start:** 2026-01-13
- **Final submission deadline:** 2026-02-24 23:59 UTC

## Team & submission limits

From the Official Rules and Submission Instructions:
- **Max team size:** 5
- **Submissions:** 1 submission per team (hackathon format)
- You submit via a **single Kaggle Writeup** (can be unsubmitted, edited, and resubmitted before the deadline).

## What you must submit (minimum requirements)

Your submission is a **Kaggle Writeup** attached to the competition’s Writeups page. It must include:
- **Video demo:** required, **≤ 3 minutes**
- **Write-up:** required, **≤ 3 pages**
- **Reproducible code:** required (public repo + enough instructions to reproduce initial results)

Bonus items (optional):
- Public interactive live demo app
- Open-weight Hugging Face model tracing back to a HAI‑DEF base model

Note: If you attach a **private Kaggle Resource** to a public Kaggle Writeup, Kaggle will automatically make that Resource public after the deadline.

## Tracks (how prizes are awarded)

All submissions compete in the **Main Track** and may additionally be considered for **one** special award:
- Agentic Workflow Prize
- The Edge of AI Prize
- The Novel Task Prize

If you select multiple special awards, organizers will consider your submission for only one of them (chosen at random among the ones you selected).

## Judging / evaluation criteria

Submissions are judged (not scored on a dataset) using weighted criteria:
- **Effective use of HAI‑DEF models (20%)**: using HAI‑DEF appropriately; using at least one HAI‑DEF model is mandatory
- **Problem domain (15%)**: importance, unmet need, clarity, user journey
- **Impact potential (15%)**: potential real-world impact, with a defensible estimate
- **Product feasibility (20%)**: technical feasibility, model performance analysis, app stack, deployment considerations
- **Execution & communication (30%)**: clarity and polish of video, write-up completeness/readability, and code quality
