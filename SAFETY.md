# Safety Guidelines & Disclaimers

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**MedGemma EBP Copilot is a demonstration tool for educational and research purposes only.**

This application is designed to showcase AI-assisted evidence-based practice workflows. It is **NOT** intended for clinical use and should **NOT** be used to make real medical decisions.

---

## Intended Use

This tool is designed to:
- Demonstrate PICO framework clinical question formulation
- Show evidence retrieval workflows using PubMed
- Illustrate AI-assisted medical literature synthesis
- Serve as a prototype for the Med Gemma Impact Challenge

---

## What This Tool Does NOT Do

1. **Does not provide medical advice** - All outputs are for demonstration only
2. **Does not replace clinical judgment** - A qualified healthcare provider must make all medical decisions
3. **Does not guarantee accuracy** - AI models can produce incorrect or incomplete information
4. **Does not verify retrieved evidence** - PubMed results are fetched but not validated for clinical applicability

---

## Known Limitations

### AI Model Limitations
- May hallucinate information not present in training data
- May provide outdated recommendations
- May not account for individual patient factors
- May miss important contraindications or drug interactions

### Evidence Retrieval Limitations
- Only searches PubMed database (excludes other sources)
- Limited to abstracts (full-text not analyzed)
- Results ranked by recency and study type, not clinical relevance
- No critical appraisal of retrieved studies

### System Limitations
- No authentication or access control
- No audit logging
- No HIPAA compliance
- Demo data only - do not enter real patient information

---

## Recommended Safeguards

For any application of this technology to clinical settings:

1. **Human-in-the-loop** - All AI outputs must be reviewed by qualified clinicians
2. **Validation** - Extensive testing against known clinical scenarios
3. **Regulatory review** - Compliance with applicable medical device regulations
4. **Data protection** - HIPAA/GDPR compliance for patient information
5. **Audit trails** - Logging of all AI recommendations and clinical decisions

## Responsible AI Principles

This demo follows Google's Responsible AI practices:
- Transparency in AI capabilities and limitations
- Human oversight for all outputs
- Focus on augmenting, not replacing, clinical expertise
